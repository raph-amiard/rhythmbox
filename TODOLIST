### Correct ADSR. DONE (I think)

* Need to check the correct behavior under working software
* Implement exp transfer for attack, decay and release
* Implement plotter to verify correct behavior

### Polyphony:

#### Hard part 1: Generate the voices

* Implement cloning of Generator trees ? Boring and difficult.
* Better: Poly takes the constructor for the regular mono instrument, and calls
  it as many times as needed to create the number of voices.
* Plus side: Goes well with hard part 3.

#### Hard part 2: Cloning should be able to have params that affect every clone.

IDEA/

* Hide every parameter behind the Poly generator.
* The poly generator will have one parameter for each parameter in his original instrument.
* When modified, it will modify the parameter for every voice at once.

#### Hard part 3: Note generators should not trigger every voice at once.

IDEA/ For this we need:
* Instrument constructor for a monophonic instrument that'll take only one note source.
* The poly constructor will take the instrument constructor, the note
  generator, and call the instrument constructor with proxy note generators
  that will do a ring dispatch of notes.

* More filters (BP, HP, 4 poles).
* Equalizer.
* Reverb.
* Make delay work again.
* Sampler.
* Logarithmic scale for ADSR and some parameters.

ENGINE

* Serialize / Load & Save
* Song mode
